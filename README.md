# Goles

Goles is a simple application for keeping track of basic statistics relating to various football leagues.

I find it a useful environment to play with various tools and libraries in the Ruby ecosystem which I generally encounter in the real world.

It's a Rails 7 app, with a postgres db and uses Stimulus, ViewComponent and Tailwind.

The data is grabbed via the api-football API.

It's hosted at goles.soccer on an Ubuntu droplet from Digital Ocean.
